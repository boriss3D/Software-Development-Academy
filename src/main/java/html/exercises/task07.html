<h2>It's best to start the day at!</h2>
<p>
    The day started <strong> so early </strong> will allow you to start it with the most important matters, in
    the implementation of which <strong> NONE </strong> will not bother you! <br/> <i> ... it is enough
    get up!</i>

<h2>Put your phone back on the shelf before you fall asleep</h2>
<p>
    Yes, it might be a <u> subversive </u> password, but it's better to put your phone down before you fall asleep than
    to put it on
    you will drop while sleeping. The first option works well with <i> <strong> The day is best to start at 3
    in the morning! </strong> </i> and the second one with numerous diseases!
