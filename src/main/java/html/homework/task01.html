<h3>The House that Jack Built lyrics</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>This is the house that Jack built.</p>
        <p>This is the malt</p>
        <p>That lay in the house that Jack built.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is the rat,</p>
        <p>That ate the malt</p>
        <p>That lay in the house that Jack built.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is the cat,</p>
        <p>That killed the rat,</p>
        <p>That ate the malt</p>
        <p>That lay in the house that Jack built.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is the dog,</p>
        <p>That worried the cat,</p>
        <p>That killed the rat,</p>
        <p>That ate the malt</p>
        <p>That lay in the house that Jack built.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is the cow with the crumpled horn,</p>
        <p>That tossed the dog,</p>
        <p>That worried the cat,</p>
        <p>That killed the rat,</p>
        <p>That ate the malt</p>
        <p>That lay in the house that Jack built.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is the maiden all forlorn,</p>
        <p>That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,</p>
        <p>That tossed the dog,</p>
        <p>That worried the cat,</p>
        <p>That killed the rat,</p>
        <p>That ate the malt</p>
        <p>That lay in the house that Jack built.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is the man all tattered and torn,</p>
        <p>That kissed the maiden all forlorn,</p>
        <p>That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,</p>
        <p>That tossed the dog,</p>
        <p>That worried the cat,</p>
        <p>That killed the rat,</p>
        <p>That ate the malt</p>
        <p>That lay in the house that Jack built.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is the priest all shaven and shorn,</p>
        <p>That married the man all tattered and torn,</p>
        <p>That kissed the maiden all forlorn,</p>
        <p>That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,</p>
        <p>That tossed the dog,</p>
        <p>That worried the cat,</p>
        <p>That killed the rat,</p>
        <p>That ate the malt</p>
        <p>That lay in the house that Jack built.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is the cock that crowed in the morn,</p>
        <p>That waked the priest all shaven and shorn,</p>
        <p>That married the man all tattered and torn,</p>
        <p>That kissed the maiden all forlorn,</p>
        <p>That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,</p>
        <p>That tossed the dog,</p>
        <p>That worried the cat,</p>
        <p>That killed the rat,</p>
        <p>That ate the malt</p>
        <p>That lay in the house that Jack built.</p></li>
    <li><p>This is the farmer sowing the corn,</p>
        <p>That kept the cock that crowed in the morn.</p>
        <p>That waked the priest all shaven and shorn,</p>
        <p>That married the man all tattered and torn,</p>
        <p>That kissed the maiden all forlorn,</p>
        <p>That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,</p>
        <p>That tossed the dog,</p>
        <p>That worried the cat,</p>
        <p>That killed the rat,</p>
        <p>That ate the malt</p>
